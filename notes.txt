different auth choices(least->most complex):

- session
- JWT
- OAuth(in-house, SaaS)
- Other/Ad-hoc

authentication- knowing who the user is
authorization- already know who the user is, but who has access to what resource.

passport- a middleware that lets user authenticate using diff strategies. 
we can build our own auth strategies on top of passport. 
middleware that allows devs to create other middlewares to create strategies 

HTTP headers:
metadata about an http req

related to authentication:

cookie: cookie header of req.
set-cookie header: cookie header of response

both work together to form a server side session.

HTTP is a stateless protocol-> it doesnt remember the activities on the website unless we make it remember in some way. 

google stores user info in cookies so user doesnt need to login to google everytime he visits.

the cookies that get returned from res on first call are sent to google.com in next ping.
